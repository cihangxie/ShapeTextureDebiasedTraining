## Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks are often biased towards either texture or shape, depending on the training dataset [(Geirhos et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12231.pdf).
Our ablation shows that such bias degenerates model performance. 
Motivated by this observation, we develop a simple algorithm for shape-texture debiased learning.
 
Experiments show that our method successfully improves model performance on several image recognition benchmarks and adversarial robustness.
For example, by training on ImageNet, it helps ResNet-152 achieve substantial improvements on ImageNet (+1.2%), ImageNet-A  (+5.2%), ImageNet-C (+8.3%) and Stylized-ImageNet (+11.1%), and on defending against FGSM adversarial attacker on ImageNet (+14.4%). 
Our method also claims to be compatible to other advanced data augmentation strategies, eg, Mixup and CutMix.
